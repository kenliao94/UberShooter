# UberShooter
A webapp Hack for University of Toronto Hackathon 2015

Built on Ruby on Rail, this webapp is a good entertainment app for passanger on an Uber. Uing Google Earth API, passenger is able to track down the location of his Uber using first person view and "shoot" it down. Once the user successfully "shot" down the Uber, the webapp will send a get request to a server ran on an Intel Edison Board with Node.js. The Edison board will respond by lighting up the LED, displaying message on LCD and buzzing a buzzer.
